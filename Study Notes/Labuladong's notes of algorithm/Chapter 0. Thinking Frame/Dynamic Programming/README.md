# Dynamic Programming:

Dynamic Programming usually used to find the **extremum**.

There are three key points in Dynamic Programming:
* State Transition Equation
* Optimal Substructure
* Overlapping Subproblems

And, you can solve DP problems by top-bottom recursion with DP table (Branch & Cut), or by bottom-top base case iteration.

To solve DP problems, you can follow these steps:
1\. Find the **base case**.
2\. Define the **state**.
3\. Write the **state transition equation**.
